# Neural Network from Scratch
> Author: Kaleb Ugalde

The purpose of this project was to get a more complete understanding of the inner workings of neural networks. Using only numpy and the keras MNIST dataset, I was able to create a neural network that could predict the MNIST Handwritten numbers dataset with over 90% accuracy.

## Files
* load_data.py - Test to see how the data should be loaded
* MNIST_NN.py - Tried using torch to see if GPU ran faster. In the end numpy was faster
* numpy_MNIST.py - The numpy version of the model
* reference.py - The proof of concept for my project

## My Understanding
